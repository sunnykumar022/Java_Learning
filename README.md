# Java Learning Projects ðŸš€

Welcome to my Java learning journey! This repository contains hands-on code snippets, mini-projects, and experiments I've built while mastering Java fundamentals.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
- âœ… Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- âœ… Constructors and Instance Variables

## ðŸ§  Why This Repo?
I believe in learning by doing. Each file here reflects a concept I explored, debugged, and understood deeply. It's not just codeâ€”it's growth.
