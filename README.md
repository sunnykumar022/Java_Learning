# Java Learning Projects ðŸš€

Welcome to my Java learning journey! This repository contains hands-on code snippets, mini-projects, and experiments I've built while mastering Java fundamentals.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
- âœ… Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- âœ… Constructors and Instance Variables
- âœ… Method Overriding (`toString`)
- âœ… Multithreading and Synchronization
- âœ… File Structure and Compilation
- 

## ðŸ§  Why This Repo?
I believe in learning by doing. Each file here reflects a concept I explored, debugged, and understood deeply. It's not just codeâ€”it's growth.

# Java Multithreading Example: `Mult2.java`

This project showcases a basic implementation of **multithreading in Java** using the `Thread` class. It demonstrates how two threads can execute concurrently, each performing a different task based on its assigned name.

## ðŸš€ What It Does

- Creates two threads from the same class `A`.
- Assigns each thread a unique name:
  - `"printNu"` prints numbers from 1 to 20.
  - `"printCh"` prints uppercase letters from A to Z.
- Starts both threads simultaneously to illustrate concurrent execution.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Thread creation using `extends Thread`
- Overriding the `run()` method
- Using `Thread.currentThread().getName()` to control thread behavior
- Basic loop-based output for characters and numbers
- Concurrent execution and interleaving of outputs
